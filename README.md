- React Router 6.2.1
- BrowserRouter
- Forms
- Controlled Inputs
- Event Handlers

# Features
-Our `landing page` is a winner. It's simple, but the complex, carousel of visuals almost make it edible. One bite, and you're hooked into our world of recipes. It also has an `About Us` link, connecting the user to us -- the team that built this app.

-Functionality immediately by clicking the imagery, navigating to recipes.

-A unique `search bar` that defines the phrase 'dietary bliss by omission'.

-Besides the incredible recipes, the `reviews` section allows the user to best steer the next avid recipe-r towards recipes aligned with their cravings.

## Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1st..

Clone the repository: git clone 

2nd...

Navigate to the project directory:

cd `project...`

3rd...

Install dependencies: npm i

Start the development server: npm start

### Components
`About` Component
The `About component` simply links the go-to information for the **About Us** page that informs any user on the make-up and contact info about our group, Heaven Seven -- 4 creators of the **recipEATS!** site/app.

`Landing` Component
For the `Landing component`, this is your first stop on our page as a user. From this Landing page, there's a 'carousel' medley of images, each one if clicked on, takes you to the more detailed list of Recipes page, displaying our various recipes and dishes.

`Carousel` Component
The `Carousel component` is to grab the user's attention with the imagery of 3 different recipe dishes, making the app more appealing and engaging.

`Recipe` Component
The `Recipe component` is to display the details for individual recipes, for the user to add feedback and reviews, including 1-5 star ratings, country of origin, whether it's vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free, and is a huge part of the app, which for us, must have an inclusion of community.

`Recipes` Component
The `Recipes component` -- not to mixed up with the above 'Recipe' component, displays every recipe available, broken down by dish image, dish name and of course the recipe's list of ingredients.

`Header` Component
The `Header component` is up top, as its name suggests, on the landing page. It's the simplest component, carrying our *recipEATS!* title/link and our 'About Us' link.

`ReviewsForm` Component
The `ReviewsForm` holds a separate file for each fetch. For the two functions, one fetch grabs all the recipe data, and another fetch grabs one recipe based on the ID.

`RecipeDetails` Component
Our `RecipeDetails component` works hand-in-hand with the `Recipes` component to give the user a taste of some very entertaining details about the recipe. From their 'country of origin' to 'Spice Level', and from 'Meal Prep' time to  giving the user the option to even 'Add review'. 

### Routing
We used (5) Routes for the following files below:

-Index.html

-About.jsx

-Recipes.jsx

-Recipe.jsx

-RecipeDetails.jsx

#### Bonus Items
Stretch Goals:

-Reviews or comments or ratings are options for any user to do  for any recipe resource that persists in JSON server, making our app more interactive.

-Most, if not all our images, are stored and uploaded in a Cloudinary account, owned by one of our squad members: Marlon.

# 5 USER STORIES

-The app should be free to download and available on both Apple App, Google Play stores.

-The app should include filters to cater for user customization for recipes 'without' certain ingredients.

-As a first-time user, navigation and smooth functionality to minimize frustration is key.

-As a user suffering from allergies, the app must make sense to show me my options.

-As a repeat user, any new discovery should lead to continued revisits.

-As an avid user, there should be opportunities through the app to build a community.

-As a user, trust is extremely important so the products must deliver and mean as it says.

-As a user, I want to discover easy-to-follow recipes.

-As a user, I want to be able to also search for recipes based on specific ingredients.

-As a user, there must be a diverse range of recipes. Variety is the spice of life!

## A User Persona:

Here's **Connor**, he's a dessert fiend, but absolutely can't have any recipe that includes sugar, which for sweetness, could be replaced with the following: agave, honey, or coconut shavings/flakes. He's on the right site for his sweet-tooth cravings, with our recipEATS app!
