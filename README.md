Moving from a group project to a solo one, isn't easy. That's why we have to budget so carefully, we scale back on the word itself! Haa!  Enter the `*Budgtr App*`! A solo project to build a 'simple' app to track and in some cases, chart different types of transactions. Below, you'll soon see that I used this list of **Project Tools & Skills**:
- React Hooks

- BrowserRouter
- Forms
- Components
- Controlled Inputs
- Event Handlers
- Fetch API

# Features
-There's simplicity to when you first enter my `home page`.

-Functionality? Click around and navigate to meet your necessary transaction endpoints, keys and keypoints.

-Back `home` already? I told you it's a simple app, you'll spend little time on it so you can get back to their busy schedules.

## Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1st..

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/MarlonPelau/project-budgeting-app-frontend.git 

2nd...

Navigate to the project directory for *frontend* (or *backend*):

cd `project-budgeting-app-frontend`

3rd...

Install dependencies: npm i `express` `dotenv` `cors` `.env` `react-router-dom`

Start the development server: npm start

### Components
`Navigation` Component
The `About component` simply links the go-to information for the **About Us** page that informs any user on the make-up and contact info about our group, Heaven Seven -- 4 creators of the **recipEATS!** site/app.

`TransactionDetails` Component
For the `Landing component`, this is your first stop on our page as a user. From this Landing page, there's a 'carousel' medley of images, each one if clicked on, takes you to the more detailed list of Recipes page, displaying our various recipes and dishes.

`TransactionForm` Component
The `Carousel component` is to grab the user's attention with the imagery of 3 different recipe dishes, making the app more appealing and engaging.

`TransactionRow` Component
The `Recipe component` is to display the details for individual recipes, for the user to add feedback and reviews, including 1-5 star ratings, country of origin, whether it's vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free, and is a huge part of the app, which for us, must have an inclusion of community.

`Transactions` Component
The `Recipes component` -- not to mixed up with the above 'Recipe' component, displays every recipe available, broken down by dish  

### Routing
We used (6) Routes for the following files below:

-Index.html

-Navigation.jsx

-TransactionDetails.jsx

-TransactionForm.jsx

-TransactionRow.jsx

-Transactions.jsx

#### Bonus Items
Stretch Goal(s):

-Displaying `bank account total` in Navigation.jsx component for the **Create Transaction** (static) button visible on all views. 

-A resuse of a stretch goal from my last project: using the `cloudinary` site for hosting images right in this README.md file.

# 5 USER STORIES

-As a first-time user, navigation and smooth functionality for immediate calculations in budgetary needs.

-As a repeat user, consistency is key, what works and has worked, please don't break it.

-As an avid user, there should be prompts to encourage positive reviews about Budgtr.

-As a user, the hardwork falls on the app, not the user - the app must do the work!

-As a user, accuracy is of the utmost importance to avoid inconveniences.

## A User Persona:

Here's **Connor**, he's always on the run, and like a calculater does for us, he's not in the mood to work the math out himself. In other words, his brain isn't brain-ing for this detail, he has no grip on what transactions come, go and how these amounts calculate. He's doing a millions different tasks daily, he only has that luxury of time on the weekend, when he wants to relax. So during the week, the `Budgtr` app does the work for him: tracks transactions, does tally totals and for his hands on use of the app, he can create new types of transactions as it 'requires', read through details, make adjustments or updates + delate if needed!

With `Budgtr`, my tagline is: *"the MATH is always MATHing!"*

# ABOUT ('fun fact') ME:

"My sub-roots are West Indian, and I grew up on an island where the population is about 43% Black/African + 43% East Indian, 1% Syrian, 5% Mixed, 2% Chinese, 5% White and about 1% Venezuelan immigrants. Can you guess what such a diverse island this is?"
